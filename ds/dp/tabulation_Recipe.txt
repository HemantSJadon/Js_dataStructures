Tabulation recipe:

1. Visualise the problem as a table (1D : array, 2D: jagged array)
2. Size the table based on the inputs (remember off by one scenerio) ( single input: 1D, double inputs: 2D) 
3. Initialise to the default values
4. seed the trivial answer (base case ) into the table
5. Iterate through the table
6. fill further positions based on the current positions
(what are the next options to move)

Tabulation gives the most effective solution out of the box
